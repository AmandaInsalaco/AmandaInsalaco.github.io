                <p>The first project I worked on at the ALC involved creating a 3D model. I chose to create a jack-o-lantern for Halloween. I had drawn and painted pumpkins before, but I had never made them come to life in the way that 3D modeling allows. I worked hard to learn not only the computer technology that allowed me to model, UV map, and texturize my object but also industry best practices in the 3D modeling field. This required me to go above and beyond the instruction and requirements of the course. My hard work and extra effort paid off. Not only did I create a 3D jack-o-lantern, but I carefully applied light and adjusted the camera angle to produce the desired haunting effect on my audience.</p>

                <p>The second project I worked on at the ALC involved creating a sci-fi scene. I choose to create a hallway in a space station. I worked very hard to use computer technology to make it look as realistic as possible. But what made this project even more exciting was that I was able to incorporate my 3D model into a video game engine called Unity. This allowed people to actually experience it in virtual reality. Everyone was able to walk up and down the hallway in my space station and look out the windows to see the stars and planets in the outer space that I had created.

                <p>The third project I worked on at the ALC involved creating a short 3D animated film. I was very excited about using computer technology to tell a story with my computer generated art. Instead of using pre-rigged human assets from the Maya software that required very little effort, I wanted to stretch myself by creating an entirely new asset that moved quite differently than a human. I chose to create a 3D animated short film about a wormâ€™s adventure in a kitchen. This was challenging not only because I had to create a 3D worm to star in my animated short film, but I also had to create an entire 3D kitchen in which it would interact. The end result was well worth the extra effort. Seeing how much my audience was impacted by my memorable and unexpected 3D animated film made me excited about pursuing this area in computer technology.</p>

        <p>I've always loved art. When I started my associate degree at the ALC, I saw that I could take a yearlong course in 3D graphics and animation. I was excited to learn how computer technology could be used as another medium for art. I immersed myself in several 3D computer programs, such as Maya, Blender, Substance Painter, and others. This state-of-the-art software allowed me to transform my art into 3D models that I could rig and animate for short films and video games. Check out some of my favorite peices I've created below! </p>
