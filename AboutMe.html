            <p>I fell in love with computer technology one day when I was eight years old. I accompanied my father to work and job shadowed him at the MTC in Provo. I was fascinated with the language teaching and learning tools that he was developing. Not only were these online tools graphically impressive, but the intuitive user interface made the user experience exciting. Tens of thousands of missionaries a year used these tools to learn how to be missionaries and to do it a new language. I knew that day that I wanted to pursue a career that involved computer technology.</p>

            <p>Since then I've worked very hard to learn as much computer technology as possible. I've taken and excelled in every computer technology course offered by UVU at the ALC. These include 3D graphics, 3D animation, scripting for animation, computer programming, video game development, digital media, and HTML. I've completed 23 college credits and earned an A in all of my computer technology courses. Not only am I well on my way to completing all of the required higher education necessary for me to start a career in computer technology, I've worked very hard in all of my other concurrent courses and will be graduating with an Associate of Science degree from Utah Valley University in May 2019 with a 4.0 GPA. This accomplishment means that I'll be able to start taking upper division courses in my major this fall.</p>

            <p>One of the many things that have intrigued me the most about computer technology is the diversity of the discipline. No other industry is so broad. With skills in computer technology, a person can develop apps for education, for entertainment, or for personal improvement. Graphic designers, animators, web developers, and so many others must have strong computer technology skills. At the Advanced Learning Center, I've been able to explore this industry by taking a breadth of computer technology courses. Ultimately, I've found that my game development class, which combined graphic design and computer programming, connected the broad expanse of the computer technology industry into one field. I'm really excited about the opportunities that I'll have in computer technology. </p>
